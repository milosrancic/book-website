					<h3>Book</h3>
					<div class="about-book">
						<p>A grumpy yet loveable man finds his solitary world turned on its head when a boisterous young family moves in next door. </p>

						<p>Meet Ove. He's a curmudgeon, the kind of man who points at people he dislikes as if they were burglars caught outside his bedroom window. He has staunch principles, strict routines, and a short fuse. People call him the bitter neighbor from hell, but must Ove be bitter just because he doesn't walk around with a smile plastered to his face all the time?</p>

						<p>Behind the cranky exterior there is a story and a sadness. So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove's mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul. All of which will change one cranky old man and a local residents' association to their very foundations. </p>

					<h4>Quotes</h4>
					<div class="quotes">
						<p>“I just wanted to know what it felt like to be someone you look at.” 
						</p>
						<p>"People said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was color. All the color he had."</p>
						<p> “He went through life with his hands firmly shoved into his pockets. She danced.” </p>
						<p>“You miss the strangest things when you lose someone. Little things. Smiles. <br> The way she turned over in her sleep. Even repainting a room for her.”</p>
